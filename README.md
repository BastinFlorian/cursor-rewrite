# Cursor Rewrite

A project to recreate the Cursor Agentic mode - an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write, understand, and debug code more efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the functionality of Cursor's Agentic mode, which provides AI-assisted coding capabilities. The goal is to build a similar tool that can:

- Understand and generate code based on natural language instructions
- Provide intelligent code suggestions and completions
- Help debug and explain code
- Refactor and optimize existing code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BastinFlorian/cursor-rewrite.git
   cd cursor-rewrite
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the application interface where you can interact with the AI assistant.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Generate code from natural language descriptions
- **Code Completion**: Get intelligent code suggestions as you type
- **Code Explanation**: Get explanations for complex code snippets
- **Debugging Assistance**: Identify and fix bugs in your code
- **Refactoring**: Improve code structure and readability
