# Cursor Rewrite

A project to recreate the Cursor Agentic mode - an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write, understand, and debug code more efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the functionality of Cursor's Agentic mode, which provides AI-assisted coding capabilities. The goal is to build a similar tool that can:

- Understand and generate code based on natural language instructions
- Provide intelligent code suggestions and completions
- Help debug and explain code
- Refactor and optimize existing code

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand for state management
- Radix UI for accessible components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BastinFlorian/cursor-rewrite.git
   cd cursor-rewrite
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash

# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```
